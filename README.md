# Economic Implications of Immigration in the United States: Immigrant Wages, Are They Worth It?

This project was inspired by many of my peers and mentors from both back home in Russia and my alma mater, Suffolk University. Immigration is a difficult topic to discuss even if
you are of the same political identification as the person you are talking to. This project was started and finished in 2020 - the last year of former presidency. 
Immigration has bewcome one of the biggest topics of his narrative. In this project I establish that in fact, no matter the legal status and field of work, imigrants
always earn less than native workers.
